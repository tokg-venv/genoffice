/**
 * The downloadable font store, shared by every app that can fetch a family.
 *
 * ## Why this is not in apps/slides
 *
 * The catalog is data and the store is the plumbing around it; neither belongs
 * to the app that happened to need them first. Keeping them here is what lets
 * docs and sheets offer the same families without each re-deriving the CDN
 * rules, the checksum discipline and the licence bookkeeping.
 *
 * ## Why the environment arrives as an argument
 *
 * `electron-utils` carries "no Electron dependency, pure TS" in its
 * description, and the store needs `app.getPath` and `net.fetch`. Passing them
 * in keeps that true — and makes the whole thing testable without spawning an
 * Electron process, which is the point of the extraction.
 *
 * ## The rule the callers must honour
 *
 * A family is tens of megabytes — Noto Serif SC alone is 28 MiB. Nothing here
 * decides *when* to download; `listCatalog` hands the caller the byte count so
 * a UI can ask first. Downloading on a bare selection is this store's caller's
 * decision to get wrong, not the store's to make.
