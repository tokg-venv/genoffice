/// Withholding cell values from the model, on the reading side.
///
/// The marks themselves live in `xl/gxRedactions.json` (see
/// `xlsx-gateway/gateway/xlsx-redaction`). This module turns them into the only
/// thing the read tools need: a question they can ask about a cell — "is this
/// withheld, and what is it called?" — answered without ever touching the value.
///
/// Two shapes of leak matter here, and only the first exists in the other apps:
///
/// 1. **Direct.** `read_range` / `read_cells` hand the value over. Fixed by
///    substituting the placeholder.
/// 2. **By arithmetic.** `aggregate_range` computes an exact `sum` over a
///    column. One withheld cell inside it is solvable: sum − everything else.
///    No amount of masking the cell fixes that, because the cell is not the
///    only source of its value. So a withheld cell must not *participate* in a
///    statistic at all — see `addWithheld` in ./aggregate.
///
/// The part is keyed by sheet NAME (that is what the save pipeline addresses),
/// while the read tools address sheets by id. `buildRedactionIndex` is where
/// that translation happens, so no call site has to remember it.
