/**
 * Incremental image loading: each decoded image is surfaced in small batches
 * instead of waiting for the whole deck (385 pictures used to render nothing
 * until the last one settled). Loaded/in-flight urls are tracked across calls
 * so re-collecting urls after an edit never reloads or discards progress.
 *
 * #763 follow-up — media is *decode-on-demand* now:
 *
 * - the caller passes only the urls the app needs at that moment (the slides on
 *   screen plus a neighbour for prefetch), so opening a 409-slide deck no longer
 *   decodes all 138 of its images up front. Measured on the reporter's deck that
 *   was ~1.9 GB of the 3.2 GB process memory and ~38% of the time to first paint,
 *   with most of the GPU process's bytes being image textures.
 * - a decoded image is kept at most `maxSide` px on its longest side. The stage is
 *   1280 px wide and a rail thumbnail 126 px, so a 3000 px photo has no reason to
 *   be held at 3000 px. Images already within the cap keep their `<img>`; larger
 *   ones are drawn once into a canvas at the capped size, which is what is kept.
 * - the decoded set is bounded by `budgetBytes`: least recently needed images are
 *   dropped and reported through `onEvict` so the UI forgets them, which is what
 *   keeps memory flat while the user pages through a long deck.
