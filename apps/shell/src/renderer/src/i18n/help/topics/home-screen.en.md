# The Home screen: where your files live

Home is GenOffice's start page: a navigation sidebar on the left, file lists and quick-create cards on the right.

## Sidebar navigation

- **Recent**: files you opened recently, grouped by time (this week / this month / earlier).
- **Starred**: files you starred. Hover a file row and click the star to add or remove it.
- **Genspark Projects**: after signing in to your Genspark account, shows the projects you created with Genspark AI on the web; click one to continue editing in the browser. Search, sort by time, refresh and load-more are supported.
- **Folders**: pin frequently used directories to the sidebar (Add folder...) and jump to them like bookmarks. Unavailable roots show as unavailable and can be removed from the list.
- **Trash**: points at the system trash — deleted files go there and can be restored from the OS.

## The file list

Each row shows an icon, the file name, modification time and more. The row's **⋯ menu** offers:

- **Rename**: inline, extension preserved automatically.
- **Star / Unstar**
- **Duplicate**: creates a copy in the same folder.
- **Delete**: moves the file to the system trash — not a permanent delete.
- **Reveal in folder**: locates the file in your file manager.

## Search

The search box at the top matches two things at once:

- **File names**: quick filtering by name.
- **File contents**: GenOffice indexes your files in the background (text inside docx/xlsx/pptx/pdf/md/html, with OCR fallback for scanned PDFs), so searching body text finds files too. Scope and toggles live in the search settings.

## Quick start cards

The cards above the lists create a new document in one step. Clicking a card creates a file of that type and opens its editor — start writing right away, or let the AI draft for you (every editor has an **AI button** in its ribbon, and **Ask AI** in the selection context menu).

The new file lands in the folder currently selected in the sidebar; with no selection it goes to the default folder.

What each card does:

- **AI Docs** (.docx): a blank text document in the Docs editor. The file is only written to disk on **first save**; new documents open with the AI panel expanded (turn that off under Settings → "Open the AI panel in new documents").
- **AI Sheets** (.xlsx): a blank spreadsheet in the Sheets editor. Until you save, no file exists on disk — the name is reserved for the first save; after the first AI generation the file can also be renamed automatically from its content.
- **AI Slides** (.pptx): a blank presentation in the Slides editor.
- **AI Markdown** (.md): a blank Markdown document in the Markdown editor.
- **AI HTML** (.html): a blank web page in the HTML editor.
- **AI PDF** (.pdf): different from the rest — it **immediately** creates a real blank single-page PDF in the target folder and opens it as a regular file (the PDF editor works on real files). Good for annotating, redacting or adding text; the file can be renamed automatically from its content on first save.
- **Open local files**: a system file picker for Word (.docx/.doc), Excel (.xlsx/.xlsm/.xls/.csv/.tsv), PowerPoint (.pptx/.ppt), PDF, Markdown (.md/.markdown) and web pages (.html/.htm). Multi-select works; each file gets its own tab.

> Tip: File ▸ New in the menu bar creates the same document types (⌘N/Ctrl+N defaults to a text document); dragging a file into the window opens it.

## Cloud projects (Genspark Projects)

- First use requires signing in to your Genspark account (device-code flow: GenOffice shows a code, you finish logging in in the browser).
- The project list syncs with the web; Open in browser jumps there to continue.
- Not signing in affects none of the local features.
