# The HTML editor

The HTML editor opens .html / .htm with two modes: **preview** (the rendered page) and **source**.

- **Preview**: true rendering; relative stylesheets and images load next to the file.
- **Preview inspector**: click to select an element, double-click to edit its text in place, toolbar delete, and Ask AI against the selection.
- **Source mode**: edit the HTML; ctrl+F find, Replace All saves the rewritten markup.
- **Saving**: byte-faithful (BOM/CRLF/trailing newline preserved); unmodified saves do not rewrite.
- **Zoom**: ctrl+wheel / pinch scales the preview; ctrl+Z inside the preview undoes the last edit.

## The toolbar

- **File & history**: Save, Save As, Undo, Redo, Find; the **AutoSave** toggle writes changes on a timer.
- **Preview / Source** switch; **Present** shows the page full-screen.
- **Formatting**: bold, italic, font size up/down; the **style panel** for the selected element (colors and more).
- **Insert**: heading, paragraph, table, image (by link), more.
- **Image actions** (with an image selected): crop, **remove background**, replace, lock aspect ratio.
- **Element actions** (with an element selected in the preview inspector): delete, duplicate, move up/down.
- **AI button**: opens the AI panel; ask about the selected element directly.
